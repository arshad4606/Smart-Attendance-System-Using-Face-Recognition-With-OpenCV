# Smart-Attendance-System-Using-Face-Recognition-With-OpenCV
The Smart Attendance System is an innovative solution designed to automate the process of attendance management using facial recognition.
Traditional attendance system, whether manual or biometric, often suffer from inefficiencies, inaccuracies and risk of proxy attendance. The project addresses these challenges by leveraging advanced image processing algorithms and tools like OpenCV to implement the real-time face detection and recognition.
The System captures facial images through a high-definition camera, processes them to extract unique facial features, and matches them against a pre-stored database to verify. 
Upon successful recognition attendance is automatically recorded with a timestamp and stored in a structured database.
