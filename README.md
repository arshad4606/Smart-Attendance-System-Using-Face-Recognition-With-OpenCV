# Smart-Attendance-System-Using-Face-Recognition-With-OpenCV
The Smart Attendance System is an innovative solution designed to automate the process of attendance management using facial recognition.
Traditional attendance system, whether manual or biometric, often suffer from inefficiencies, inaccuracies and risk of proxy attendance. The project addresses these challenges by leveraging advanced image processing algorithms and tools like OpenCV to implement the real-time face detection and recognition.

The System captures facial images through a high-definition camera, processes them to extract unique facial features, and matches them against a pre-stored database to verify. 

Upon successful recognition attendance is automatically recorded with a timestamp and stored in a structured database.

MODULES:

1.Image Capturing.

2.Preprocessing.

3.Face Detection And Recognition.

4.Attendance Management. 

IMAGE CAPTURING:
The system captures real-time images for facial recognition.
The system captures using a webcam or other compatible camera for input.
The system converts the captured images to grayscale for preprocessing.

PREPROCESSING:
The system processes the captured images to prepare them for recognition.
Converts images to grayscale and enchances quality.
Normalize the image for consistent feature detection.

FACE DETECTION:
The system identifies and locates faces in the captured images. 
The system detects the face using OpenCV for facial landmark detection.
The system detects multiple faces in a single image if required.
 
FACE RECOGNITION:
The system matches the detected faces with stored data for identification.
The system compares the images with the pre-trained dataset stored in the database.
The system uses LBPH algorithm or similar for high accuracy in facial recognition.

ATTENDANCE MANAGEMENT:
The system automates attendance marking and data storage.
The system records attendance with a timestamp for recognized individuals.
The system allows viewing, editing and exporting attendance records in various formats (e.g., CSV, Excel).
